# IPA

## Inspiration

It's a game we all had the itch to play, so we made it. Sometimes you want to have a nice time playing games with friends, but you're not close to your console or your PC, so having a nice and challenging party game that can be played with your cellphone can be a good alternative.

## What it does

It is a party game, in the style of Mario Party or Wario Ware that can be played with your phone.

## How we built it

We used python for the server and Haxe for the client, using HaxePunk as the game engine.

## Challenges we ran into

* Communicating the client and the server.
* Coming up with mini-game ideas.
* Networking problems.
* Making artwork, as we are all programmers.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

* We made a fun game.
* We finished a working demo.
* It's an overlooked genre on an underestimated platform.

## What we learned

* Teamwork communication.
* HaxePunk game development.
* Multithreading with python.

## What's next for IPA

* Polish the games.
* Add more games.
* Let the users create different lobbies to play the game with their friends.
* Add ads to generate money.
* Take advantage of the different sensors of smartphones (gyro, camera, microphone, etc.) to improve the game experience.
